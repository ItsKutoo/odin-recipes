<h3>How to make bread</h3>

<p>For this recipe I'm going to show you how to make the lightest, fluffiest bread out there.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>500g white flour, extra is optional for dusting</li>
    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>7g sachet of fast-action yeast</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>300ml water</li>
   
</ul>
 
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol> <li><p>Mix the 500g white flour, 2 tsp salt and the 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</p></li>
     <li><p>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix </p>
         <p>mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix.</p></li>
     <li><p>Lightly flour a clean surface and knead for about 10 minutes.</p></li>   
         <li><p>Once its satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film, leave to rise for an hour until it had doubled in size, or you can place in the fridge overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Knock back the dough which is punching the air out and pulling the dough back in on itself, then gently mould it into a ball</p></li>
        <li><p>Place it on the parchement paper to sit for another hour until its doubled in size.</p></li> 
         <li><p>Pre-heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</p></li> 
         <li><p>Dust the loaf with flour if you want and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</p></li>  
         <li><p>Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and the loaf sounds hallow when tapped underneath. Leave to cool on a wire rack and you have your bread.</p></li>
        </ol>
